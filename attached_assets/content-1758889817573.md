You can redirect customers that already have an active subscription to the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal) or your website to manage their subscription. This redirection works with [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) (including the [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)) and Payment Links.

Stripe uses either the [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer) (if you provide it in the Checkout Session) or the email address to detect if a customer already has an active subscription.

## Direct your customers to the customer portal or your website![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Customer portal

Your website

1. [Activate the no-code customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/activate-no-code-customer-portal) to allow your customers to log in and manage their subscriptions. You need to keep the login link for the customer portal enabled to keep this feature enabled. Disabling the login link disables this feature, which means that customers can create multiple subscriptions.
2. Enable redirecting your customers to the customer portal in your [Checkout and Payment Links settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout#subscriptions).

![Subscription settings](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-settings.28f8c4efc7a1ca0efceeee8ebeae4786.png)

## Active subscription statuses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Active subscriptions have the following [four statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status):

- `Active`
- `PastDue`
- `Unpaid`
- `Paused`
