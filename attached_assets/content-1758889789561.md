# Configure freetrials

## Delay payments on subscriptions using free trial periods.

Ask about this page

Copy for LLM

View as Markdown

Stripe doesn’t set a specific limit on a free trial length. Most businesses use shorter trials (such as 30 days), but you can set longer periods. However, consider:

- Keeping payment methods valid for post-trial charges
- Potential impact on conversion rates with longer trials

Stripe-hosted page

Embedded form

You can configure a Checkout Session to start a customer’s subscription with a free trial by passing one of the following parameters:

- [subscription\_data.trial\_period\_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_period_days), the length (in days) of your free trial.
- [subscription\_data.trial\_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_end), a Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period.

## Free trials without collecting a payment method ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

By default, Checkout Sessions collect a payment method to use after the trial ends. You can sign customers up for free trials without collecting payment details by passing [payment\_method\_collection=if\_required](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_collection).

Choose whether to cancel or pause the subscription if the customer doesn’t provide a payment method before the trial ends by passing [trial\_settings.end\_behavior.missing\_payment\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_settings-end_behavior-missing_payment_method).

- **Cancel subscription**-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it cancels immediately. You can create another subscription if the customer decides to subscribe to a paid plan in the future.
- **Pause subscription**-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it pauses and doesn’t cycle until it’s resumed. When a subscription is paused, it doesn’t generate invoices (unlike when a subscription’s [payment collection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment) is paused). When your customer adds their payment method after the subscription has paused, you can resume the same subscription. The subscription can remain paused indefinitely.

### Collect payment details automatically ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Before the trial expires, collect payment details from your customer.

Under **Manage free trial messaging** in your [Subscriptions and emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), you can choose to automatically send a reminder email when a customer’s trial is about to expire.

Next, select the **Link to a Stripe-hosted page** option so the reminder email contains a link for the customer to add or update their payment details. We don’t send free trial reminder emails in a sandbox. Learn more about how to [set up free trial reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#trial-ending-reminders).

You must comply with card network requirements when offering trials. Learn more about [compliance requirements for trials and promotions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#compliance).

### Collect payment details in the Billing customer portal![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

You can also send the reminder email yourself, and redirect customers to the Billing customer portal to add their payment details.

First, configure the [Billing customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to enable your customers to manage their subscriptions.

Next, collect billing information from your customers:

1. Listen to the `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` [event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.trial_will_end).
2. If the subscription doesn’t have a [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method), get the customer’s email using the [Customers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) and send them a message with a link to your site. It’s helpful to embed the customer ID in the email, for example `https://example.com?...&customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}}`.
3. When the customer lands on your site, create a customer portal session using the customer ID from the previous step.
4. [Redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal#redirect) the customer to the customer portal, where they can update their subscription with payment details.

Your customers can also [resume their paused subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#resume-a-paused-subscription) in the customer portal by selecting **Start subscription**, then adding a payment method. View [free trial periods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment) to learn how to configure a subscription to pause or cancel when a free trial ends without a payment method attached.
