## Readme

# FLUX.1 Kontext - Text-Based Image Editing

FLUX.1 Kontext is a state-of-the-art image editing model from Black Forest Labs that allows you to edit images using text prompts. It’s the best in class for text-guided image editing and offers superior results compared to other models like OpenAI’s 4o/gpt-image-1.

## Available Models

- **[FLUX.1 Kontext \[dev\]](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-dev)**: Open-weight version with non-commercial license (commercial use available through Replicate)
- **[FLUX.1 Kontext \[pro\]](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-pro)**: State-of-the-art performance with high-quality outputs, great prompt following, and consistent results
- **[FLUX.1 Kontext \[max\]](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-max)**: Premium model with maximum performance and improved typography generation

## What You Can Do

Kontext excels at:

- **Style Transfer**: Convert photos to different art styles (watercolor, oil painting, sketches)
- **Object/Clothing Changes**: Modify hairstyles, add accessories, change colors
- **Text Editing**: Replace text in signs, posters, and labels
- **Background Swapping**: Change environments while preserving subjects
- **Character Consistency**: Maintain identity across multiple edits

## Prompting Best Practices

### Be Specific

- Use clear, detailed language with exact colors and descriptions
- Avoid vague terms like “make it better”
- Name subjects directly: “the woman with short black hair” vs. “she”

### Preserve Intentionally

- Specify what should stay the same: “while keeping the same facial features”
- Use “maintain the original composition” to preserve layout
- For background changes: “Change the background to a beach while keeping the person in the exact same position”

### Text Editing Tips

- Use quotation marks: “replace ‘old text’ with ‘new text’”
- Stick to readable fonts
- Match text length when possible to preserve layout

### Style Transfer

- Be specific about artistic styles: “impressionist painting” not “artistic”
- Reference known movements: “Renaissance” or “1960s pop art”
- Describe key traits: “visible brushstrokes, thick paint texture”

### Complex Edits

- Break into smaller steps for better results
- Start simple and iterate
- Use descriptive action verbs instead of “transform” for more control

## Commercial Use

When using FLUX.1 Kontext on Replicate, you’re free to use outputs commercially in apps, marketing, or any business use.

## Example Applications

Check out these [specialized apps](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps) built with Kontext:

- [Portrait series](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/portrait-series): Generate portrait variations from a single image
- [Change haircut](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/change-haircut): Modify hairstyles and colors
- [Iconic locations](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/iconic-locations): Place subjects in famous landmarks
- [Professional headshot](https://replicate.com/flux-kontext-apps/professional-headshot): Create professional portraits

## Tips Summary

- **Be specific** with colors, styles, and descriptions
- **Start simple** and iterate on successful edits
- **Preserve intentionally** by stating what to keep unchanged
- **Use quotation marks** for exact text replacements
- **Control composition** by specifying camera angles and framing
- **Choose verbs carefully** \- “change” vs “transform” gives different results
