You can explicitly set a subscription’s [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-billing_cycle_anchor) to a fixed date (for example, the 1st of the next month) when creating a Checkout Session. The billing cycle anchor determines the first full invoice date, when customers are billed the full subscription amount. The billing cycle anchor and the recurring interval of its [price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview) also determine a subscription’s future billing dates. For example, a monthly subscription created on May 15 with an anchor at June 1 is billed on May 15, then always on the 1st of the month.

For the initial billing period up until the first full invoice date, you can customize how to handle [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) with the [proration\_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-proration_behavior) parameter. By default, `proration_behavior` is set to `create_prorations`, and customers receive a prorated [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). If `proration_behavior` is `none`, customers receive the initial period up to the first full invoice date for free.

## Create a Checkout Session with a billing cycle anchor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To configure a billing cycle anchor, set the `subscription_data.billing_cycle_anchor` parameter when you create a Checkout Session in `subscription` mode. The anchor must be a future UNIX timestamp before the next natural subscription billing date.

If the billing cycle anchor is during a session’s active period and a customer attempts payment after it has passed, Checkout displays and charges for the full period starting with the billing cycle anchor instead of the prorated period before the billing cycle anchor.

## Disable prorations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To disable prorations, set the `subscription_data.proration_behavior` parameter to `none` when creating a Checkout Session.

Similar to a free trial, the initial period up to the billing cycle anchor is free. Unlike a trial, no 0 USD invoice is generated. Customers receive an invoice with the full subscription amount on the billing cycle anchor date.

In the Checkout Session response object, amounts attached to the [line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-line_items) and [total details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-total_details) are always 0 when prorations are disabled. Additionally, the [payment status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-payment_status) of the Session is set to `no_payment_required` to reflect that payment is delayed to a future date.

## Limitations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

- You can’t use trials in Checkout Sessions with a billing cycle anchor.
- You can’t use one-time prices in Checkout Sessions when `proration_behavior` is `none`.
- You can’t apply [amount\_off coupons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/create#create_coupon-amount_off) to Checkout Sessions with a default `proration_behavior` of `create_prorations`.
